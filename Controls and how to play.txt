How to Play

Use the arrow keys or keys 'a','s','d', and 'w' to move
your character. Aim your mouse where you want to shoot
and right click the mouse to fire. 

Fight through as many rounds as you can, each has more
enemies than the last. Most enemies take one bullet to kill,
but look out! If two enemies touch eachother they merge.
Both increasing in size and health. You only have a limited
health which is shown by the red bar at the top of the screen.
Health resets at the end o each round.

The radar in the bottom right shows the direction of all enemies
currently not in your view.

Good luck!
